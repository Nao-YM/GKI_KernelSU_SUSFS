## MomenToMoiX Driver

A kernel-level CPU/IO optimization driver that reacts to screen state, charging status, and thermal state, with suspend-awareness and hotplug-safe QoS handling.

**How it works:**

- **Screen state detection:** Polls `DPMS` first, falling back to backlight brightness, at an interval of `poll_interval_ms` (default 1000 ms), starting `boot_delay_ms` (default 40 s) after boot to let the display driver finish probing. Both the DPMS and backlight node are resolved from a **candidate list** at boot rather than a single hardcoded path, so the same build works across devices with different sysfs layouts without a rebuild — including `leds/lcd-backlight` panels alongside the more common `backlight` class.
- **Screen OFF:**
  - Isolates the `system-background` and `background` cpusets to CPU 0.
  - Switches the I/O scheduler to `none` (the previously active scheduler is auto-detected and saved so it can be restored later).
  - Applies a CPU frequency bias: both the min and max frequency QoS are pinned to the same target, calculated as `min_freq + (max_freq - min_freq) * bias%`. Charging and non-charging use **different bias percentages** — `charging_freq_bias_percent` (default 20%) applies while charging, `doze_active_freq_bias_percent` (default 10%, i.e. closer to the floor / more aggressive throttling) applies otherwise.
  - Scans every available thermal zone (up to 15) and takes the **highest** reported temperature. If it's at or above `thermal_threshold_mc` (default 65 °C), a thermal hold is armed for when the screen turns back on.
- **Screen ON:**
  - Cpusets and I/O scheduler are restored immediately.
  - If a thermal hold was armed, the device's current temperature is rechecked **immediately** on wake — if it has already cooled below `thermal_threshold_mc - thermal_hysteresis_mc` (default 60 °C) while the screen was off, frequencies are released right away instead of waiting out a stale hold. Otherwise the screen-off bias is held for `thermal_hold_ms` (default 3 s) and rechecked each poll cycle until it cools down.
  - If no thermal hold is active, CPU frequencies are restored to stock and a **Wake Boost** is triggered (see below).
- **Wake Boost:** on every screen-on that isn't blocked by a thermal hold, a configurable frequency floor (`wake_boost_percent`, default 100%) is held for `wake_boost_ms` (default 1200 ms) via a dedicated workqueue, so the unlock animation and first app launch feel snappier before control hands back to the stock governor. If the screen turns off again before the window expires, the boost is cancelled cleanly instead of racing with the screen-off bias.
- **Suspend-awareness:** a PM notifier tracks true suspend (`PM_SUSPEND_PREPARE`/`PM_POST_SUSPEND`) versus just screen-off-but-awake. During an actual suspend cycle the watcher now parks itself instead of touching cpuset/I-O-scheduler/cpufreq sysfs nodes mid-transition, and forces a full display-state resync right after resume so it never acts on stale state.
- **Hotplug-safe QoS:** frequency QoS requests are kept in sync with live cpufreq policies via a policy notifier, so CPUs/clusters that come back online after being hotplugged off are picked back up automatically instead of being silently excluded from throttling until the next reboot.
- **Runtime tunable:** every threshold above (`poll_interval_ms`, `boot_delay_ms`, `thermal_threshold_mc`, `thermal_hysteresis_mc`, `thermal_hold_ms`, `charging_freq_bias_percent`, `doze_active_freq_bias_percent`, `wake_boost_percent`, `wake_boost_ms`) is a writable module parameter — no rebuild needed to tune behavior.

**Requirements:**

Screen state detection needs one of:
- DPMS: `/sys/class/drm/card0-DSI-1/dpms` (additional DPMS candidates can be added to the driver's candidate list)
- Backlight, tried in order:
  - `/sys/class/backlight/panel0-backlight/brightness`
  - `/sys/class/leds/lcd-backlight/brightness`
  - `/sys/class/backlight/panel0/brightness`

Charging-aware behavior additionally looks for one of:
- `/sys/class/power_supply/battery/status`
- `/sys/class/power_supply/bms/status`
- `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status`

Thermal-aware behavior reads `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp` through `thermal_zone14/temp` and uses whichever zones are actually present.

If a node isn't found on your device, the corresponding feature is disabled/skipped automatically and logged — the rest of the driver keeps working normally.

**Verify it's running:**

```bash
su -c 'dmesg -w | grep momx'
```
after the device finishes booting.

**Tune it live:**

```bash
su -c 'ls /sys/module/momx/parameters/'
su -c 'echo 60000 > /sys/module/momx/parameters/thermal_threshold_mc'
```

## Governor Reflex

A schedutil-based governor extension that blends real idle-time CPU busy% (measured from kcpustat counters) with PELT utilization to get a faster-reacting "hispeed floor" without abandoning PELT's proportional scaling.

Frequency scaling itself is identical to stock schedutil, including the 1.25× DVFS headroom — only the hispeed blend differs:

- On each observation window, actual CPU busy% is measured from kcpustat idle-time accounting (not PELT), giving an immediate, non-decayed read of current load.
- This reading is blended with PELT util using exponential decay tied to PELT's own 32 ms half-life:

  ```
  blended = pelt + (hispeed - pelt) >> half_lives
  ```

- Every 32 ms, the hispeed contribution halves while PELT fills in the same gap, so total coverage stays at ~100% throughout the transition.
- After roughly 320 ms, the hispeed contribution is negligible and PELT-based proportional scaling has taken full control.

The effect is a governor that reacts instantly to a real load spike (via the idle-time-based hispeed reading) while smoothly handing off to PELT's steady-state behavior within a third of a second — avoiding both the lag of pure PELT and the overshoot of a naive instant-boost.

## Governor Vorpal

**Vorpal v2.0 — Perfect Gaming & Thermal Edition**, a schedutil-derived governor built around switching cleanly between sustained gaming load and everyday power-efficient use, with per-cluster tuning on tri-cluster (Little/Big/Prime) SoCs.

- **Dual-Profile Operating Modes** — a Gaming profile that locks into a high-frequency band for consistent frame timing, and a Daily profile tuned for power efficiency.
- **Tri-Cluster Topology Awareness** — Little, Big, and Prime clusters are tuned independently rather than sharing one global policy.
- **Directional EMA Util Smoothing** — an exponential moving average filter that rises fast on load spikes but decays slowly, avoiding frequency "yoyo-ing" between samples.
- **Dynamic Capacity Headroom** — OPP headroom above the measured load scales with how loaded the CPU already is, rather than a fixed margin.
- **Proactive Thermal Step Controller** — frequency caps ramp down in small ~2% steps and back up in ~1% steps, smoothing thermal response instead of hard-clamping.
- **Thermal Zone Integration** — reads hardware thermal sensors with a userspace-fallback path if a zone is unavailable.
- **Frame Pacing & Miss Recovery** — detects overruns against a 120fps budget and applies a bounded floor boost to recover pacing.
- **Global Frame Boost** — a dropped-frame event synchronizes a boost across all clusters, not just the one that missed.
- **Touch Input Responsiveness Boost** — lifts the frequency floor for a 220 ms window after touch input for immediate UI responsiveness.
- **UI Ramp-Assist / Render Burst** — detects sharp utilization ramps typical of animations/scroll bursts and responds ahead of the normal control loop.
- **Adaptive Floor (Idle/Busy)** — Prime and Little clusters switch between idle and busy frequency floors dynamically.
- **Directional Rate Limiting** — separate up/down rate-limit gates per cluster instead of one shared rate limit.
- **IOWait Performance Boost** — retains schedutil's legacy IOWait boost handling.
- **Deadline Bandwidth Awareness** — SCHED_DEADLINE task bandwidth can bypass normal frequency selection when needed.
- **Jank Telemetry & Statistics** — tracks and reports frame/jank ratios for tuning and debugging.
- **Deferred IRQ-Work Frequency Commit** — an async path for platforms without fast-switch support.
- **Global Policy State Reset** — cleanly resets all boost/state on leaving the Gaming profile.
- **GKI 5.10 Util Interface** — uses `rfx_get_util_gki510` / `rfx_dl_bw_exceeded_gki510` for utilization and deadline-bandwidth queries on the GKI 5.10 ABI.
- **Scheduler Coupling** — exposes `sched_gaming_active` so BORE/CFS scheduler biases can react to the active gaming profile.

**Usage:**

Set the governor on the cluster(s) you want, then flip the gaming switch on the **Prime cluster only** — that's the cluster the governor auto-detects as highest-capacity, and it's the only one exposing the gaming/thermal/frame attributes.

```bash
# set governor on all clusters
for p in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy*/; do
  echo vorpal > "${p}scaling_governor"
done

# find which policy is Prime — it's the one with the full attribute set
for p in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy*/vorpal/; do
  ls "$p" | grep -q gaming_mode && echo "Prime cluster: $p"
done

# toggle gaming mode (replace policyN with the Prime cluster found above)
su -c 'echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policyN/vorpal/gaming_mode'   # gaming ON
su -c 'echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policyN/vorpal/gaming_mode'   # back to Daily profile
```

## Governor Bara-no-Seidou

A schedutil-derived governor built in-house for this kernel, tuned specifically for dual-cluster (Little/Big) SM6225-class SoCs. Named after Malice Mizer's *Bara no Seidou*.

- **Headroom, Not Discount** — instead of shaving measured utilization down before mapping it to a frequency, capacity is padded with margin so the resolved OPP has slack. The margin is tiered by load (negligible at low utilization for battery, more as utilization climbs for responsiveness) and per-cluster (Little gets more headroom than Big).
- **Dual-Profile Gaming/Daily Switch** — reads the same `sched_gaming_active` flag Vorpal exposes, so both governors' scheduler-side biases stay in lockstep regardless of which one is the active cpufreq governor.
- **Instant Up, Rate-Limited Down (Gaming)** — zero delay on upward frequency changes while gaming; downward changes stay rate-limited to avoid yoyo-ing.
- **Gaming Exit Hysteresis** — a short grace window after gaming mode drops keeps the gaming profile active, so a loading screen or brief app-switch doesn't flip profiles mid-session.
- **Directional EMA Util Smoothing** — rises instantly on load spikes, decays slowly, avoiding frequency oscillation between samples.
- **Touch-Boost Input Responsiveness** — a dedicated input handler suspends the daily headroom curve for a tunable window after any touch event.
- **UI Ramp-Assist** — a sharp rise in utilization percentage (not just a touch event) re-arms the same responsiveness window, catching fling-scrolls and animations that a touch-only boost would miss.
- **Per-Cluster Daily Shaping** — the Little cluster is capped during idle-ish background work and released during active UI; both clusters get a frequency floor while UI is active.
- **Hold-Freq Across Idle Blips** — frequency is never dropped based on a utilization sample taken right after a brief, non-representative idle blip.
- **Decaying IOWait Boost** — doubles on sustained IOWait, halves once it stops, instead of snapping on/off every tick.
- **Thermal Step Controller** — the applied thermal cap steps down quickly on rising pressure and recovers gradually, avoiding oscillation right at the thermal trip point.
- **PSI-Aware Floor & Cap (opt-in)** — reads system-wide Pressure Stall Information as a 10-second-smoothed signal: sustained CPU pressure can raise a frequency floor, sustained memory pressure can lower a cap, catching sustained scheduling/paging stalls that per-tick utilization never sees. Off by default.
- **Screen-Resume State Reset** — hysteresis and decay state left over from before a suspend is cleared on the screen-off → screen-on edge, so a long suspend can't bias the first post-resume decision window.
- **cpufreq_this_cpu_can_update Safety Gate** — guards against a CPU that isn't entitled to drive a shared policy (relevant on multi-CPU Little clusters) from acting on it.
- **Fast-Switch Aware** — explicitly enables cpufreq fast-switch where the driver supports it, only falling back to a dedicated SCHED_DEADLINE kthread where it doesn't.
- **Fully Runtime-Tunable** — every threshold above is a writable sysfs attribute under `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policyX/bara-no-seidou/`, no rebuild needed to tune behavior.

**Usage:**

```bash
# set governor on a cluster
echo bara-no-seidou > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_governor
echo bara-no-seidou > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy4/scaling_governor

# toggle gaming mode (shared with Vorpal's sched_gaming_active)
su -c 'echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy4/bara-no-seidou/gaming_mode'   # gaming ON
su -c 'echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy4/bara-no-seidou/gaming_mode'   # back to Daily profile
```
